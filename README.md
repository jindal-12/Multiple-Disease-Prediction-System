# Multiple Disease Prediction System

## Overview

The Multiple Disease Prediction System is a machine learning-based application designed to predict the likelihood of multiple diseases based on user input data. The system leverages various algorithms to provide accurate predictions, enabling early detection and preventive measures for a range of diseases.

## Features

- Predicts multiple diseases based on user input.
- Utilizes machine learning algorithms for accurate predictions.
- User-friendly interface for easy data input.
- Provides detailed results and recommendations.

## Model Training

The system uses various machine learning algorithms to train models for different diseases. The training data includes various health indicators and patient records.

### Steps for Model Training

1. Prepare the dataset.
2. Preprocess the data (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, etc.).
3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Train the models using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.
5. Evaluate the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. Save the trained models for prediction.
